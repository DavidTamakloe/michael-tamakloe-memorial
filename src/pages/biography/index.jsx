                                Michael Tamakloe was born in Odumase Krobo on 18 th July 1968 to Mr. Edwin Kofi Tamakloe, a Road and Building
                                contractor and Madam Emily Laako Bah Tamakloe, a general trader, both of blessed memory. He was baptized into the
                                Presbyterian Church.

                                <br />
                                Michael, also called Kordza, grew up in both Odumase Krobo and Accra and therefore had his childhood education in both
                                places, Presbyterian Primary School in Odumase Krobo, popularly known as ‘Labour’, and Datus Preparatory School,
                                Dansoman where he sat the Common Entrance Examination and passed. Michael was enrolled for a short time at the Ecole
                                Jean Jacque Rosseau, a French school in Accra New Town where he quickly picked up French speaking. He enrolled in
                                Presec Boys Secondary School, Legon in September 1981 and obtained his ‘O’ Level and ‘A’ Level Certificates in 1986
                                and 1988 respectively. In September 1990, Michael gained admission to the University of Science and Technology (UST),
                                now Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), to read French, English and Law, and graduated in 1994
                                with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English and Law.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Michael’s working life began at Ceramica Tamakloe where he joined his big brother’s company for a while. He ventured
                                out on his own making concrete pavement blocks and ultimately became a contractor, supervising various civil works,
                                and gaining other contracts and running projects, some of which took him on business trips outside Ghana. Mike had his
                                ups and downs in business but pressed on for the ultimate. In his last years, he developed interest in quarry mining
                                but unfortunately was not able to see that through to the end.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A very affable person and the soul of every gathering. Mike had a great relationship with all his siblings, both on
                                his mother side and his father side, the larger family, his 2 cousins, and all his nephews and nieces. His presence
                                was always felt during family events. His leadership qualities were evident as early as his school days in Presec
                                where he became one of the three Dining Hall prefects; he even ventured into sports and music in school. Michael had a
                                lot of charisma and knew how to make and keep friends.

                                <br />
                                Mike was a member of the International Central Gospel Church (ICGC), Holy Ghost Temple, Frafraha, where his
                                relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ grew and deepened. His faith was very infectious and evident in all his
                                utterances; Christ became the foremost in all he did. Mike never hesitated to share his faith or encourage prayer in
                                every situation.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Michael, his dear wife of eighteen years, Joyce, and their beloved son Selasie, blessed many people with love, who
                                visited their home. We started becoming aware of a pain in Michael’s right leg in January 2020. Within a matter of
                                months Mike’s health deteriorated until his passing on 27 th May 2020. Michael will be remembered for his friendly and
                                charismatic presence and his unshakeable faith in Jesus Christ. We believe that he has gone to be with his Maker. He
                                is mourned by his wife Joyce, his son Selasie, his siblings, wider family and a host of friends.
